"""The client's input record: what it pressed, frame by frame. It ends every client datagram.

The client never sends its position (only the message channel and this record have writers,
0x7FF7896D0930), so a server that shows a player to others has to move the player itself.

Layout (writer 0x7FF789B3DDC0, command writer 0x7FF789B3DD00):
    1 bit present, u32 length in bits, then u16 latency ms, u8 key flags, u8 count (1..32), and the
    commands oldest first. The first is complete:
        u32 frame | throttles | s16 yaw | s16 pitch | 24 bits buttons | u8 action |
        [buttons & 0x10000: u8 sub-frame, s16, s16] | u16 extra
    Each later one is a change against the one before:
        frame + 1 if bit 0, else + U(2, 6 bits or 32) | bit 0 = the same command again, else
        throttles | bit -> pitch += S(8, 10) | bit -> yaw += S(8, 10) | bit -> extra += S(5, 8) |
        bit -> buttons | bit -> action | [sub-frame data]
    Throttles: bit present; bit compact: 1 -> bit (0 = none, 1 = 3 bits direction), else bit ->
    s8 right, bit -> s8 forward.
Angles are s16 units of 2 pi / 65536; forward is (sin yaw, 0, cos yaw) and right (-cos yaw, 0,
sin yaw). The pitch is positive looking down. One command frame is one tick of the game.

The extra is the client's view delay in ms (clock +0x98 plus +0x9C, times 1000: how far in the past it
draws other bodies). The sub-frame data (command +0x12, 0xFF when not sent; the two angles +0x0E, +0x10)
says when in the frame a click came, as 255ths, and where it aimed then (unverified: yaw first, as in the main
pair). The client's own hit test runs at the view time of the frame (0x7FF7894BEE40): the frame's time
less (extra + round((1 - sub-frame / 255) * frame ms)) ms (0x7FF7894BEEC0).
