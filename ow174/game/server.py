"""The game server: one UDP port for every match, one thread.

The lobby sends each player of a match 20600 with this server's address, a connection id of their
own and two keys (lobby/matchmaker.py). The client then sends SYN datagrams with that id in the
header until it gets SYN|ACK, and the session is open with its first ACK. From then on the server
sends one world frame per tick; the first reliable message is 20300 (load the map).

Datagrams go to their game by that connection id, as in the client: it routes every datagram by the id
in its header and opens it with that connection's keys, whatever the address (0x7FF7893127F0). All
links of one game share one socket (0x7FF78930F920), so a game that goes from one match to the next
sends the old connection's FIN and the new one's SYN from the same address; the address of a client
follows its newest datagram.
