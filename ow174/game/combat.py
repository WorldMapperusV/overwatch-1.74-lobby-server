"""Shots, damage, death and respawn: what the server decides and what it tells the clients.

What the client needs (read in the client unless marked):
- Health is component 51 (world.pool): an op-2 update of a pool's field changes the bar on every client
  that has the body. A body whose health pools (type 0) add up to 0 with a maximum above 0 is dead
  (0x7FF789ADBF00): the client then sets flag 0x2000 on its movement state (0x7FF7896A4F9A) and the 3P
  animation takes the dead pose 004.015 (0x7FF789B24889); flag 0x2000 in the records does the same.
- ClientInCombat 25001 {entity, u32 damage, u8 flags} u32 frame (handler 0x7FF7895D2D40) tells the shooter
  of a hit: it goes in his component 59's hit list (+0x12D0, records in frame order, not on his own
  body), which shows the target's health bar for 5 s (0x7FF7895D8520: int(1e6 / quanta) * 5 frames) and
  feeds the hit marker and its sound (event 7). Flag bit 0 counts at +0x124, else +0x120; bit 1 at +0x128.
  Unverified: bit 0 = critical, bit 1 = kill (the OW2 cross-check: 19 / 38 damage with 0 / 1, the last hit 2 /
  3).
- 25005 {u64, entity, entity victim, u8 score, bool assist} (0x7FF7895D2B50) and 25004 {u8, entity}
  (0x7FF7895D2A70) post 0F76.025 and 0F7B.025 / 0F7C.025 to the game mode entity's statescript
  (0x7FF7895D7AF0, the first component-114 entity): its graph 1FC0 (a client-only child of 0CB6) shows
  "ELIMINATED: <name>" (1126.07C), "YOU WERE KILLED BY <name>" (1127.07C) or "YOU DIED" (1128.07C). So
  the mode entity carries 0CB6 (mode_frame); the kill feed 0DEA is its child too.
- The kill feed line: the dead body's 01CF takes game message 003E.025 (the body's "died": killer 0012,
  crit 0095, loadout 03E6, assists 03E7), pulses its ClientOnlyPulser st108, and every client's 01CF sends
  0765.025 to the mode entity's 0DEA (DATA). So the server gives 003E.025 to the dead player's body
  script; its frames carry the line.

What the server decides here:
- A shot is a volley's shot in the shooter's body script (nodes.WeaponVolley.report): hitscan along the
  command's aim from the eye (STUFirstPersonComponent m_E29993A5 = 1.55 m, crouched m_816B830F, DATA;
  unverified as the eye height), or a projectile (m_projectileSpeed) flown each tick.
- Damage from the volley's hit definition (the graph data, evaluated by the body script): the
  ModifyHealth amount (Soldier 20, Helix 40 and 80 splash, quick melee 30), unverified: falloff from
  m_EAD7F104 to m_157E5BC5 metres down to m_72A81154 (30 m, 50 m, 30 %), critical times m_A872C70E (2), splash
  scaled between the explosion rings (1 m: 1.0, 3 m: 0.5). Shields, then armour (5 less a hit, at most half:
  unverified, OW1's rule; the client has no damage code), then health.
- Quick melee: 0043 st4 (ModifyHealth) on what its st5 TrackTargets would find (MELEE). The Biotic Field
  heals through heal_area (projectiles.py). A dead body's statescript takes no presses (the VM's
  owner_dead, as the client's LogicalButton 0x7FF78AAAC570), so the dead do not shoot.
- Bodies are capsules from the feet to the mover's height (radius the mover's, DATA; unverified as a hitbox),
  a hit at or above the eye height less HEAD_BELOW is critical (unverified). Shots stop at the map's collision
  (the mover's part of it, which the server keeps). Allies are not hit.
- Targets are where the shooter's client showed them: at the command's view time (commands.py: the
  frame's time less the view delay the command carries, 0x7FF7894BEE40 / 0x7FF7894BEEC0), from the
  server's own record of where each body was in every tick (the records the clients got, bots too),
  between two ticks by a straight line (unverified: as the client draws them), at most HISTORY ticks back.
- Respawn: heroes after the mode's time (Practice Range 3 s, PvP 10 s: the mode graphs' 06FD.025 to the
  body script 0C8E, DATA), at the spawn point as a new body (match.switch_hero); training bots after
  BOT_RESPAWN (unverified: 3 s in the OW2 cross-check) as new entities at their spawner.
