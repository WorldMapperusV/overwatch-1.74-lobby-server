"""Statescript on ch1: frames that put graph instances on an entity and set their states and
variables. The client runs the graphs; the server says which instances exist and what is on.

Read in the client (our IDA; the chunk reader 0x7FF7898A6450, the frame 0x7FF78991E3C0):
- A chunk is `w_u32 first | w_var span | bit fragmented | w_var size in bits | payload`. first 0 is a
  full frame. The client keeps the highest `last` (first + span) it applied and drops chunks at or
  below it, so an unchanged chunk can be sent again safely.
- The payload starts `bit lead | bit H`; with H (an owner frame): `bit C | w_var CmFD`, and in a delta
  also `w_var LBSS` (the body's length). An owner frame is skipped unless its CmFD is larger than the
  last one (unsigned, so 0 never applies).
- A full frame lists the instances (w_u16 index steps, each with a descriptor: 16 bits graph, bit other
  entity, bit flag, bit parent -> w_var parent instance and w_var parent STATE index, bit references),
  then the entity's variables, then per instance its variables, one bit per state, and in an owner
  frame its event list; then the frame's event list. It destroys the network instances it does not
  list and first clears the variables the network set, so every full frame carries everything.
- In an owner frame the states are the graph's m_states minus the client-only and server-only ones.
  A SubScript state that is on carries its child's instance id (w_u16) and a bit.
- Instances the server makes never run their own Entry nodes (only client-only ones run), so the
  server sends what those would have done: the states that are on and the variables.
