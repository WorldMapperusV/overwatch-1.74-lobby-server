"""A match: its players, their entities, and what each player's client is told.

How a player gets into the world:
- When the map is loaded the client sends 21601 (and later 21602). 0.3 s later the server sends
  20302 {the player entity}: "this is your entity" (0x7FF7896E6C10 writes world +0x298). It has to
  come before the player's create, or the client does not add its command components (59, 63).
- 0.6 s after loading, one frame creates the map's server-owned placeables (the loading screen only
  ends once they all exist), the player entity (000E.003, flags 0x3C) and the game mode entity
  (16B2.003).
- Then the player's entity gets its controller's statescript (heroselect.py): the HUD and the hero
  select screen. That frame puts the entity's statescript in owner mode, so small owner frames keep
  telling the client which of its commands the server has (CmFD), else it replays old key presses.
- The hero's body comes with the pick, as in retail (OW2 traffic): the body with its movement state
  and an update of the player entity whose component 44 possesses it. A switch replaces the body
  under a new id in the same frame (the client ignores a destroyed id for 30 s).
- The client then moves the body itself; it never tells the server where it is. The server moves
  a copy from the commands, and that copy is what the other players see.
- In the PvP modes the first spawn starts "assemble your team": 30 s shown on the hero select
  screen, which stays open after a pick and closes when the time is up.
- Every client also gets the other players' entities, as in retail (their team lists, B_team_list
  research): each one's card (20308: name, icon, level), his entity with his id, and a plain frame
  with the team list entry 288D and his pick. 288D leaves enemies out of the list on the client.
  The entity also names his portrait frame (component 74), which makes the client load it: the list
  draws a frame only when it is loaded. On a competitive card the match is a ranked one (20300) and
  the entity carries his rank (component 29), which the list shows in place of level and frame.
