"""Competitive play: the ranked state, message 36300.

It comes from the 1.68 retail capture: season 32 (January to March 2022) on the role queue card 1B3
(tank, damage and support ratings), the open queue card 1B4, Lunar New Year's Competitive CTF (1C3),
and 73 past seasons with their reward tiers. 1.74 added three fields to each rating record; they are
0. The ratings themselves are the profile's (the capture's 2333 by default).

An event's competitive Arcade card (Competitive CTF, the Summer Games' Lucio Cup 1AD) runs a season
of its own while the Arcade shows it, as 1C3 did in the capture. The group finder offers such a card
only when every member of the group has a rating on it (the group check below).

Every competitive season is a card of its own (0C7). The season list (+0x98) gives its number
(+0x118), and from season 23 an open queue card names it as its parent (+0xF0): season 1 is 0xDD,
18 (the first with roles) 0xC2, 32 0x1B3 with open queue 0x1B4. The profile picks the season; its
cards take season 32's place, its dates move to the server's clock, and later seasons are left out.

The client looks a rating up by card, role, platform and matchmaking pool. It asks for the PC
platform and, when a PC player is in the group (player card +0x3C = 1), the PC pool; a console-only
group asks for pool 16020070. The capture's ratings have pool 0, which 1.74 never asks for, so every
competitive card was locked with "group members' skill ratings differ too much".

A rating record (36300 +0x80, 36302), as the client's rank icon and rating getters read it
(0x7FF78934CFB0, 0x7FF789AB61F0, 0x7FF789930400):
    +0x18 skill rating (0: none this season; below 500 it shows as "<500"), +0x1A season high,
    +0x1C Top 500 place (the rank icon becomes the Top 500 one), +0x1E season high place,
    +0x20 the rating shown while placements run, +0x22 tier of +0x18, +0x23 tier of +0x1A,
    +0x28 placement results (1, 2 or 3 each; their count is the matches played), +0x40 placements run.
A party member carries the same in 20700 +0x68: +0x10 rating, +0x12 place, +0x14 placement rating,
+0x16 tier, +0x17 placements run, +0x18 placement tier.
