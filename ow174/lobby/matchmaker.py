"""Matchmaking: parties that search a queue are put into full matches, and their games go to the
game server.

A queue card's rules (data/game_queues_174.json, tools/extract_game_queues.py) give its teams, the
players per team, the role slots of a role queue (two of each role per team) and its maps. A party
always plays on one team. A match starts once the waiting parties fill every team exactly and, in a
role queue, every player gets one of the roles they picked. Parties that waited longest go first.
For tests, a minimum number of players starts a match early with whoever is waiting.

What the client needs (read in IDA):
- 44202 {queue key, reason} drops the client's queue entry and stops the search timer. Every reason
  does that; reason 1 (QueuePopped) only differs in telemetry (0x7FF7896190D0). It goes first, or the
  menu keeps showing the search.
- 20600 then sends the game to the game server at once; its handler (0x7FF789685CD0) has no queue or
  menu check. +0x78 must be False: True means the struct is XOR-scrambled, and the address the client
  then reads is garbage (why our first try of 20600 never connected). The client dials the host text
  (+0x2E) and port (+0x2C), puts the connection id (+0x28) in every datagram header, and encrypts with
  the key at +0xAE; the server encrypts with the one at +0xCE. host2 (+0x6E) is only shown.
