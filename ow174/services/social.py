"""Friends, parties and chat for several players on one lobby server.

Friends are added by BattleTag and saved in both profiles. A virtual friend ("Bot") is in every
friends list and always online; it joins parties it is invited to, so the social screens can be
tried with one client.

A chat channel is {"+0x0": id, "+0x10": type, "+0x14": index}. The types used here are 4 for a
party (the id is the party id), 6 for the players of a match (the id is the match id) and 7 for
General. Whispers (type 3) use their own messages. That 6 is the match ("All") chat and 5 the team
chat comes from ProCore's notes and is not confirmed yet.
